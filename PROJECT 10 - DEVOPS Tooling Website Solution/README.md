### DEVOP TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION


As a devop Engineer or  a member of DevOps Team, you will implement a website solution which makes access to DevOps easily accessible within the corporate infrastructures.

In this project, I implemented a solution that consists of infratstructures like:
1) Infrastructure: AWS 
2) Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
3) DataBase Server: Ununtu 20.04 + MYSQL
4) Storage Server: RED Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
5) Programming Language: PHP
6) Code Repository: Github
