# LAMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION
A LAMP stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP. All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. Developers use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain web content. It is a popular solution that powers many of the websites you commonly use today. (Definition excerpt from AWS)

There are different stacks that makes it possible to build websits and web applications. These stacks of technologies are called WEB Stacks. Other WEB stacks are:
### 1. LAMP ( **Linux** **Apache** **MySQL** **PHP** )
### 2. LEMP ( **Linux** **Nginix** **MySQL** **PHP** )
### 3. MERN ( **MongoDB** **ExpressJS** **ReactJS** **NodeJS** )
### 4. MEAN ( **MongoDB** **ExpressJS** **AngularJS** **NodeJS** )
